## Goal (Measurable):

The website aims to double its current active user count of around 800 to 1200 within six months of launching the new website.

## Success Evaluation:
The criterion for determining goal attainment involves observing the website's traffic and registration numbers. 
Success is defined as achieving a monthly registration increase of 10% (excluding the first month of website launch). 
If this upward trend persists for six months and reaches or exceeds 50%, the objective is considered achieved.

## Target Audience:
Retirees aged 65 and over who:

1. Have a high level of education or a similar educational background.
  
2. Have basic knowledge of computer use and are capable of handling basic computer tasks.
   
3. Are still keen on learning new knowledge and actively seek to expand their knowledge base through online courses.
   

## Market Size:
The current focus is exclusively on the Australian market, where there are 800,000 retirees aged 65 and over with an educational background. 
Subsequent phases will explore expansion into other international regions.
